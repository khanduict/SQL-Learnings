- SQL stands for (Structured Query Language) and it is used to interact with databases such as:
  - Retrieve data
  - Analyse data
  - Define data

- What is a database?
    - It is a set of Tables in which we store structured data. The tables consists of rows and columns.
    - We retrieve the data using commands in SQL. For example, SELECT <column 1>, <column2>,...FROM <table_name>

- Schema
  - It is an additional layer that helps us to structure and organise our data. You can think of this as a folder which has different tables

- Database Management System (DBMS)
  -  We DBMS need to manage these database. In my case, i used PostgreSQL(this is DBMS - it is a software which is used to manage the database) and PgAdmin (front end graphical interface)

-  Why PostgreSQL?
    - PostgreSQL is the closest to the standard SQL
    - Most flexible and transition will be easiest
    -  Free to download and use
    -  Very propular
